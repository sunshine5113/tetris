# Angular Tetris

A child-hood memory Tetris game built with Angular 10 and Akita.

Tetris was the first game that my dad bought to me. It costed him about 1 dollar at that time. It didn't sound a lot today, but at the time of more than 20 years ago. 1$ can feed my family for at least few days. Put it that way, 1$ can buy 2 dozens of eggs. This is the only one gaming "machine" that I ever had until my first computer arrived. I have never had a SNES or PS1 at home. I saw people still selling it online for about few bucks the other day.

Why not build the same with Angular? And here you go.

> I designed the game to hold maximum score of 999999 (one million minus one ðŸ˜‚) and I have never reached to that very end.
>
> I will give <u>a free gift</u> for the **first** amazing gamer. Please tweet your screenshot together with hashtag `angulartetris` and tag my name as well `@tuantrungvo`.

## Who is this for?

I built this game dedicated to:

- Anyone tha grew up with Tetris as a part of your childhood. It was definitely my childhood memory and I hope you enjoy the game and it helps bring some good memory back to you as well.
- For Angular developer community, I have never really see a game that built with Angular and that's my answer. Using Akita as the underlying state management really helps me to see all of the data at a specific point of time, very good for debugging. I wanted to see more game from you guys.

## How to play

### Control

- You can use both keyboard and mouse to play. But prefer to use keyboard
- Press arrow left and right to change the speed of the game (1 - 6)
- Press arrow up and down to change how many of lines has been filled before starting the game (1 - 10)
- Press Space to start the game
- Press P for pause/resume game
- Press R for reset the game
- Press S for the turn on/off music

## Playing game

- Press Space make the piece drop quickly
- Press arrow left and right for moving left and right
- Press arrow up to rotate the piece
- Press arrow down to move a piece faster

## Techstack

I built it barely with Angular and Akita, no additional UI framework/library was required.
